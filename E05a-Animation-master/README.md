# E05a-Animation

-----------------------------------------
WHAT I DID:
Updated license
Added coments to comment lines in main 1 and main 2 to further explain and understand uses.
Created jpg of cow and alien space ship for main3. Opted against person and coins since everyone else woudll do that.

------------------------------------------------

We will begin to explore keyboard and mouse control in a Python Arcade program.

When you are done, main1.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_mouse.html#move-mouse). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

main2.py should contain the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/move_keyboard.html#move-keyboard](http://arcade.academy/examples/move_keyboard.html#move-keyboard). Play with the code until you feel like you understand what is going on. Comment any uncommented line; feel free to ask for help!

For extra credit, you could create a main3.py that contains the code on [http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation](http://arcade.academy/examples/sprite_move_animation.html#sprite-move-animation). Download sprite assets for the player and coins and figure out how to make your character walk left and right.
